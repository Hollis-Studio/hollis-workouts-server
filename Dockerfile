# Hollis Workouts Server — Multi-stage Docker build
# Stage 0: hollis-shared — clone + build the sibling shared monorepo
# Stage 1: deps          — install production dependencies
# Stage 2: build         — compile TypeScript
# Stage 3: runner        — lean production image
#
# Shared deps (@hollis/contracts, @hollis/auth-client) use file:
# refs against ../hollis-shared. See:
